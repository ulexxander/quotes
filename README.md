# Collection of quotes from different people that I found useful/interesting

## Design philosophy

1. We don’t make things easy to do, we make things easy to understand.
2. Let’s not do something for the sake of doing it.
3. Don’t make something complex until you absolutely have no choice.
4. Tomorrow is not promised, so you should be writing code that you need today, not tomorrow.
5. Make it correct. Make it clear. Make it concise. Make it fast.
6. Every line of code should not hide the cost of what it’s doing.
7. Everything we do must define a new semantic, some new behavior where one is absolutely precise.
8. You shouldn’t be writing code for yourself. You should be writing code for the next person that has to come along. Because if you don’t, when you leave, that codebase leaves with you. It gets replaced.

> Technical debt to me is every day a piece of code is sitting on your laptop and not in production. I am hiring you to solve a problem. That problem is not being solved on your desk, that problem is being solved in production. So if you’re not getting that code in production, what am I paying you for?

> If you’re writing more code than you need, it results in ugly, large, and slow code. Where ugly means you’re leaving places for bugs to hide, large means you’re ensuring incomplete test coverage, and slow means you now start to make shortcuts and dirty tricks away from your frameworks and your patterns, because you’re moving fast and the code gets out of control.
